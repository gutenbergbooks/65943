<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">FOREWORD</span></h2>
<p>The following letter, written by an anonymous author to an unknown
correspondent, vividly depicts the life of an American soldier on the western
frontier during the War of 1812. Reprinted from the WEEKLY REGISTER,
this letter might have been written by a twentieth-century soldier,
for the experiences, hopes, and fears of this enlisted man in the early nineteenth
century are similar to those of an American serviceman of our own
day. Hardships, sufferings, and dangers are illustrated; but good will, respect
for authority, and companionship are present in no lesser degree.
The letter is reprinted as published except that grammar, spelling, and
punctuation have been changed to conform to current usage.</p>

<p class="lr">Zanesville, Ohio</p>
<p class="lr">March 28, 1813</p>
</div>
<p>When I last wrote you from Upper Sandusky, I confidently expected
that something of considerable importance would have transpired within a
very short time; but, unfortunately, the war in this quarter is protracted
to a much longer period than I contemplated at that time. Indeed, the best-informed
people in the army think that nothing decisive can be done before
next winter. Invasions of a country with militia will never be successful.
Some militiamen will not cross the lines; others will not submit to any kind
of authority; and, in fact, they would all prefer being at home rather than
courting fame on the battlefield.</p>
<p>The Kentucky and Ohio militia have been discharged for some time;
the Pennsylvania and Virginia militia are to be discharged on April 1; and,
unless other troops arrive, the camp will, in a great measure, be unprotected.
No men will be left except our battalion, consisting of the Petersburg
Volunteers and two companies from Pittsburgh (fifty men in one and
fifteen in the other), together with about three hundred and fifty regulars.
Ensign James G. Chalmers, who is appointed paymaster for all the twelve-month
volunteers, and I left the rapids on the eighth. We have to remain
here until the arrival of the district paymaster.</p>

<p>The next day after the date of my letter from Upper Sandusky, we left
that place for the rapids, together with three hundred militia under the command
of Major Orr. We had with us twenty pieces of heavy artillery and a
quantity of military stores of every description. At this time we knew nothing
of the unfortunate events at the Raisin River. On the second day of our
march, a courier arrived from General Harrison; the artillery was ordered
to advance with all possible speed. This was rendered totally impossible
by the falling snow; it was a complete swamp nearly all the way. On the
evening of the same day, news arrived that General Harrison had retreated
to the Portage River, eighteen miles in the rear of the encampment at the
rapids. It was determined that as many men as could be spared should proceed
immediately to reinforce him. It is unnecessary to state that we were
among the first who wished to advance.</p>
<p>At two o&rsquo;clock the next morning, our tents were struck; and in half
an hour we were on the road. I will candidly confess that on that day I regretted
being a soldier. We marched thirty miles in incessant rain; and I
am afraid you will doubt my veracity when I tell you that in eight miles of
the best road, we sank into mud over the knees and often to the middle.
The Black Swamp (four miles from the Portage River and four miles in extent)
would have been considered impassable by all except men who were
determined to surmount every difficulty to accomplish the object of their
march. In this swamp one loses sight of terra firma altogether. The water
was about six inches deep on the ice, which was very rotten and often
broke through to a depth of four or five feet.</p>
<p>That same night we encamped on very wet ground, but the driest that
we could find; the rain still continued. It was with difficulty that we built
fires; our clothes were wet. We had no tents, no axes, nothing to cook in,
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
and very little to eat. Since a brigade of pack horses was near us, we procured
some flour from them; we killed a hog as there were plenty of them
along the road. Our bread was baked in the ashes, and the pork we broiled
on the coals. A sweeter meal I have never eaten. When we went to sleep,
it was on two logs laid close together to keep our bodies from the damp
ground. Good God! What a pliant being is man in adversity. The loftiest
spirit that ever inhabited the human breast would have been tamed amid the
difficulties that surrounded us.</p>
<p>The next morning we arrived at the headquarters of the northwestern
army on the Portage River. During our stay here, we were in constant expectation
of an attack. For several nights we went to sleep with our muskets
in our arms and all our accoutrements fixed for action. On the arrival
of the brigades of General Leftwich and General Crook [sic] from Sandusky,
we marched for the rapids. The Kentucky and the Ohio troops had
then only six days to serve. In a speech to them, the General pledged to
take them to Malden in twenty days, which pledge would have been fulfilled
if the cannon and military stores could have been got on. When we arrived
at the rapids, the advance guard discovered that one of the three persons,
who had been sent to Malden with a flag two days previously, had been killed
and scalped by the Indians. The other two (we have since heard) are prisoners
at Malden. So little does our enemy respect the laws of nations.</p>
<p>The encampment, protected by nature in three quarters by a steep,
high bank, is opposite the Michigan Territory in a fine situation; the whole
is picketed. The stores are deposited in eight blockhouses, built around
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
the picketing. All of the encampment is nearly in a complete state of defense.
The handsomest country along this river is in the vicinity of the
camp, but all is a scene of desolation. After Hull&rsquo;s surrender, the whole
country was laid waste by the Indians. Every half mile there had been a
house; the only remaining indication of habitation is the ruins that cover
the ground where houses once stood!</p>
<p>A few days after our arrival, a detachment, of which our company
was a part, was sent out to attack a considerable party of Indians fifteen
miles down the river. We started as night set in and marched all the way
on the ice. About two o&rsquo;clock we came near the place where we expected
to surprise the enemy. We were put in order of battle and instructed to
proceed in silence.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t2">&ldquo;Still was the pipe and drum&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Save heavy tread, and armor&rsquo;s clang,</p>
<p class="t2">The sullen march was dumb.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>In a few minutes enemy forces were in sight; they were nearly a mile
off in a bend of the river. When we were within gunshot (I could hear the
men cocking their pieces), our company, to a man, was even at that moment
cheerful and gay! Fear was far distant from our ranks; and I do sincerely
believe that, had the enemy not flown previous to our arrival, we
would all have realized the expectations of our friends. Some of their spies
(as we have since heard from prisoners from Malden) saw us on our march,
and as a consequence they made a precipitate retreat. We followed them
to within five miles of the Raisin River and returned to camp without any
rest, except for two hours. We were absent twenty-one hours, during which
time we marched more than sixty miles. You are already acquainted with
the particulars of the last unfortunate account at the Raisin River, likewise
the failure of the expedition to destroy the &ldquo;Queen Charlotte.&rdquo; Our
company marched as far as the mouth of Lake Erie to reinforce the men of
the first party, but we met them on their return. We have all built small
houses, which make us very comfortable, in front of the tents.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>The camp duty is very severe; there are no tents or houses for the
guard when the men are off their posts, so that it is equally as pleasant for
them to be at their posts as off. They are forbidden to leave the rendezvous
of the guard. Every other day a man mounts guard; on the day that
intervenes, he is at work within the camp. Major Alexander, who commands
the battalion, is as fine a fellow as I ever knew. The most perfect
harmony exists between the Pittsburgh company and ours; they are the only
two companies of twelve-month volunteers in camp, and the only companies
that wear uniforms. A generous emulation exists between them, which is
of infinite service to both. Officers and men all mingle together. We visit
each other&rsquo;s tents of an evening, sing, tell stories, play music, and drink
grog when we can get it (which, by the bye, is not often the case; sutlers
are not permitted to sell spirits in the camp).</p>
<p>Poor Edmund S. Gee is no more! I saw him breathe his last. We
consigned him to his mother earth with all the decency our circumstances
would permit. We had it not in our power to dress his corpse in all the
pomp and pageantry of sorrow. The tears of his companions, more eloquent
than all the parade that sable weeds could bestow, were his due; and
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
those he had! All the battalion attended the funeral, as did General Leftwich,
who requested the chaplain to perform a funeral service, a thing not
done on any similar occasion.</p>
<p>Chalmers and I will return to the camp in a few days. It is dangerous
to travel the roads in small parties, as the Indians are all around the
camp. We will be obliged to remain in the settlement until some troops
are going on. The day before we left the camp, a lieutenant was shot and
scalped within sight of the camp. Another man was shot at, but fortunately
in his side pocket he had a Bible, which arrested the course of the ball and
saved his life. There are one hundred miles of road between here and the
rapids without a single inhabitant&mdash;all a wilderness.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
